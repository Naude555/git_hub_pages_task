# GitHub Pages Test Page

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my test page hosted on GitHub Pages! This repository contains a simple web page that I'm using to test the functionality of GitHub Pages.

## Purpose

The purpose of this test page is to explore how GitHub Pages works and to familiarize myself with the process of hosting a website using GitHub Pages. This test page includes basic HTML and CSS content to demonstrate the rendering of web content.
